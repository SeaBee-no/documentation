## Overview {#sec-overview}

Access to SeaBee data is provided by MinIO, which offers high-performance, S3-compatible object storage. At the highest level, files within MinIO are organised into **buckets**. For example, there are currently buckets for `niva`, `nina`, `ntnu` etc. Within these, files are organised within folders and sub-folders, just like a standard file system. At present, each organisation is responsible for organising their data in a way that fits with their existing workflows. 

:::{.callout-note}
Eventually, we will define a common file and folder structure for all SeaBee data, as this will make it easier to automate common SeaBee tasks.

To access the data on MinIO, you first need to [create an account](./login.qmd#sec-minio). You can then login to the [SeaBee MinIO web interface](https://minio.seabee.sigma2.no/login) (@fig-minio-console-window) and browse files in a similar way to e.g. DropBox or GoogleDrive. If you need to work with SeaBee data from your code, there is also an S3-compatible storage endpoint at <https://storage.seabee.sigma2.no> (see @sec-upload-download for details). 

## Backups {#sec-backups}

 Files stored on NIRD follow the regular backup schedule described [here](https://documentation.sigma2.no/files_storage/backup.html#nird). For the GeoNode databases, backups should be dumped to the `seabee-backup-restore` bucket (which is then backed-up via the standard NIRD regime).

## Uploading and downloading files {#sec-upload-download}

There are several options to upload and download files to/from the MinIO storage.

### MinIO web interface {#sec-minio-ui}
 
 The minio console located at <https://minio.seabee.sigma2.no/login> provides a graphical interface to upload and download files (@fig-minio-console-window).

 On the [buckets page](https://minio.seabee.sigma2.no/buckets), click `Browse -> Upload`, then select either `Upload Folder` or `Upload File`. To download, mark the desired folder/file and click `Download`.

### SeaBee data upload portal {#sec-data-portal}

 * Describe Deb's data upload portal
 * Best option for standard/less advanced users?

### Machine Access {#sec-machine-access}

To accesss the S3 API on <https://storage.seabee.sigma2.no> you first need a service account (generated [here](https://minio.seabee.sigma2.no/identity/account)).

#### Python {#sec-python}

 All python libaries supporting the S3 API will be able to interact with the MinIO storage. One good option is the [MinIO SDK](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/developers/python/minio-py.html). In addition to upload and download, this has options to search and manage access and to retrieve metadata etc. A simple SeaBee-specific example using the MinIO client is [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/SeaBee-no/snippets/blob/main/storage.ipynb) and more general examples are [here](https://github.com/minio/minio-py/tree/master/examples). If you need file-like access, the [S3Fs](https://s3fs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for Python is also a good option.

#### Shell {#sec-shell}

 * [Rclone](https://rclone.org/) provides a convenient way of synchronising files `local -> cloud` or `cloud -> cloud`. Rclone keeps track of what has been transferred and will retry if the connection is interrupted, so **it is probably the best option for experienced/advanced users to add large volumes of imagery to Sigma2**.
