title: "Orthorectification"
---

Orthorectification is currently performed using two main tools: [Open Drone Map (ODM)](https://opendronemap.org/), which is Open Source, and [Pix4D](https://www.pix4d.com/), which is proprietary. To date, orthorectification for habitat mapping (image segmentation) has typically been handled by drone pilots using Pix4D, whereas orthorectification for seabird counts (object identification) has been done by researchers using ODM. 

Pix4D cannot be deployed on Sigma2 due to licensing restrictions, but ODM is available via the [NodeODM API](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/NodeODM). [PyODM](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/PyODM) and [CloudODM](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/CloudODM) are also provided. 

## Open Drone Map

 * Describe the configuration for ODM on Sigma2
 * Add simple examples of mosaicing test images from a MinIO bucket using both Python (PyODM) and the command line (CloudODM)
 * Best done via the JupyterHub interface?
