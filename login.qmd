Access to SeaBee's data platform is controlled via [Feide](https://docs.feide.no/general/feide_overview.html). **You can login via Dataporten [here](https://auth.dataporten.no/discovery?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Fauth.dataporten.no%2Foauth%2Fauthorization%3Fclient_id%3Ddf34f687-ff1b-419e-9b5c-55b49e4babad%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdashboard.dataporten.no%252F%26response_type%3Dtoken%26state%3D5f6ff55e-18b7-4194-8e0b-101576744ac4&clientid=df34f687-ff1b-419e-9b5c-55b49e4babad)**.

Some organisations automatically provide Feide access for all their memebrs. If you do not have organisational access, you will need to create a **Fedie Guest** account (see @sec-create-account). 

## Create a Feide account {#sec-create-account}

 1. Register a new account with Feide [here](https://openidp.feide.no/simplesaml/module.php/selfregister/newUser.php)

## Browse files using MinIO {#sec-minio}

SeaBee uses [MinIO](https://min.io/) on Sigma2 to provide an S3-compatible API for file storage and transfer. Once you have a Feide account, you can request access to MinIO by [creating an issue](https://github.com/SeaBee-no/documentation/issues) in the SeaBee repository explaining your use case and describing which datasets you need to access.

The easiest way to explore the files available to you on MinIO is via the web interface [here](https://minio.seabee.sigma2.no/login). See the [File storage](./storage.qmd) page for further details, including alternative options for interacting with SeaBee data on Sigma2.

## Data processing using SeaBee's JupterHub {#sec-jupyterhub}

SeaBee's JupyterHub provides Python and R environments offering fast and convenient access to data hosted on Sigma2. The JupyterHub is especially useful for developing and testing workflows and for sharing code with other researchers. Once you have a Feide account, you can request access to JupyterHub by [creating an issue](https://github.com/SeaBee-no/documentation/issues) in the SeaBee repository explaining your use case. You can then login [here](https://hub.seabee.sigma2.no/) using your Feide credentials.

See the [JupyterHub](./jupyterhub.qmd) page for full details.

## `Editor` permissions on GeoNode {#sec-geonode}

SeaBee data products are publicly available via the [SeaBee Geonode](https://geonode.seabee.sigma2.no/#/).
