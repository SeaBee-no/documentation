I want to...

## Create a user account {#sec-create-account}

You need to create a Feide account and then request access to the resources you will need. See the [Login](./login.qmd) page for details.

## Upload or download files {#sec-file-transfer}

The best option will depend on your level of technical expertise and the volume of data you wish to transfer. Non-technical users with smaller data volumes should consider either the **MinIO web interface** or the **SeaBee data upload portal**. For larger volumes of data (e.g. raw imagery for whole missions), command-line solutions such as **Rclone** are preferable. See [Uploading and downloading files](./storage.qmd#uploading-and-downloading-files) for details.

## Mosaic geotagged raw images to georeferenced mosaics {#sec-orthorectification}

You can use **Open Drone Map** (ODM) via either PyODM or CloudODM (e.g. via the SeaBee JupyterHub). See the [Orthorectification](./orthorectification.qmd) page for details.

## Create training data for machine learning (annotation) {#sec-annotation}

The recommended workflow for **image segmentation** tasks is to use ArcGIS Pro and the Image Analyst extension - see the [Annotation](./annotation.qmd) page for details.

## Explore and download SeaBee datasets

Orthomosaics from aerial drones and data products from the machine learning are available via **SeaBee's GeoNode**. See the [Data products](./data-products.qmd) page for details.
