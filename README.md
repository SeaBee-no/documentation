# SeaBee documentation

This repository contains technical documentation for the SeaBee project, rendered as a website using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

**The public version of the website is [here](https://seabee-no.github.io/documentation/)**.

## Updating

1.  Clone this repository (e.g. to NIVA's JupyterHub, which has Quarto installed)

2.  Modify the markdown in the `.qmd` files and, if necessary, update the header and sidebar menus in `_quarto.yml`.

3.  From a terminal, run `quarto preview`, or use quarto from for example [vscode](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html)

4.  Commit your changes and push them or create a PR if you use a different branch
