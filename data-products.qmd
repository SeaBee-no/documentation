 * The SeaBee GeoNode is [here](https://geonode.seabee.sigma2.no/#/).
 
 To do:
 
 * Describe GeoServer, GeoNode and databases test (PostGIS)
 * How do we move data uploaded to MinIO to GeoServer?
 * How do we expose orthomosaics and vector datasets as web services (WMS and WFS)? How do we add them to e.g. ArcGIS?
 * What is the difference between registered and unregistered users on the GeoNode site?
 * What can users do via GeoNode and how do they do it (create new maps, download data... ?)
